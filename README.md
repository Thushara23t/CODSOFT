# CODSOFT
During my internship at CodSoft, I worked on a series of practical projects in Python, each focusing on creating user-friendly applications:

Task Summaries:
1.	To-Do List Application: I built an app that helps users organize and manage their tasks.
The app, available in a command-line or graphical interface, allows users to create, update,
and track their to-do lists easily.

2.	Password Generator: I developed a password generator tool that creates strong, random passwords
based on the length and complexity specified by the user, enhancing user security.

3.	Rock-Paper-Scissors Game: I created an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game where users can play
against the computer. The game includes logic for determining the winner, tracks scores over
multiple rounds, and provides a user-friendly interface.
